For international\ncollaborative projects, an international or a specific National Annex may be selected.\n\nThis National Annex will assist the user in understanding the UK implementation of this standard by\ntranslating the key terms and expanding on the requirements. The topics of information container\nidentification, information container metadata, classification and information model exchange covered\nin this National Annex should be defined or referenced in the project's information standard.\n\n\n### NA.2 Information container identification (ID)\n\n\n#### NA.2.1 Clarification\n\nISO 19650-2:2018 (5.1.7.a) states: 'The project's common data environment shall enable each information\ncontainer to have a unique ID, based upon an agreed and documented convention [comprising] fields\nseparated by a delimiter'.\n\n\n#### NA.2.2 Info tion containers\n\nIn the UK, the unique ID for project file information containers within a common data environment\n(CDE) should be defined using all the fields shown in Figure NA.1 in the order shown, coded according\nto NA.3, separated by a delimiter and used in its entirety as a single unique string.\n\nField codes within the file information container ID should be formed using only alphanumeric\ncharacters (capital and lower-case letters A-Z and digits 0-9).\n\nThe convention for naming CAD layers is documented in BS EN ISO 13567-2.\n\n\nFigure NA.1 - Identification of file information containers within a common data environment\n\n![Project - Originator Functional Breakdown Spatial Breakdown - - - Form - Discipline - Number](figures/1.1 \"Rectangular nodes connected in a horizontal sequence by lines.\nNodes (left to right):\n- Project\n- Originator\n- Functional Breakdown\n- Spatial Breakdown\n- Form\n- Discipline\n- Number\")\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[Project] --> B[Originator]\n    B --> C[Functional Breakdown]\n    C --> D[Spatial Breakdown]\n    D --> E[Form]\n    E --> F[Discipline]\n    F --> G[Number]\n```\n\n\n\n\nNOTE 1 The project's information standard should document the extent to which metadata are to be added,\nas additional fields, to an information container ID when it is removed or exported from the CDE solution. In\nrelation to this, the project's information standard should identify the order of any additional fields. The delimiter\nbetween fields should be that given in NA.2.3.\n\nNOTE 2 The information container ID deliberately does not contain a description field in order to maintain\nalignment with BS EN 82045-2, where 'identification' (defined in Clause NA.2) is separate from 'description'.\n\n<!-- PageFooter: Licensed copy: BOULTING ENVIRONMENTAL, 26/02/2021, Uncontrolled Copy, © BSI -->\n<!-- PageNumber: 28 -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader: BS EN ISO 19650-2:2018 -->\n\n\n### NA.2.3 Delimiters\n\nIn the UK, the following delimiter is to be used:\n\nHyphen-Minus\nUnicode Reference U+002D\n\n\n### NA.3 Field codification\n\n\n#### NA.3.1 Clarification\n\nISO 19650-2:2018 (5.1.7.b) states: 'The project's common data environment shall enable each field to be\nassigned a value from an agreed and documented codification standard'.\n\nFile information container ID field descriptions are summarized in Table NA.1. In the UK, the\ncodification for each field should follow the codifications defined in NA.3.2 to NA.3.8. There are no\nrecommendations for field length and overall string length in the National Annex, but each field and\nthe overall string should be kept as short as possible. Specific requirements should be documented by\nthe appointing party in the project's information standard and agreed with each lead appointed party\nduring the appointment process. Field codes should be used consistently across the project team.\n\nWhere standard codes provided in the National Annex are to be expanded, then the following hierarchy\nof source documents for new codes should be used:\n\n1\\. ppropriate tables from Uniclass 2015 (the UK implementation of ISO 12006-2);\n\n2\\. recognized sector-wide codes published by a representative body; or\n\n3\\. codes developed by the appointing party.\n\nThe standard delimiter (see NA.2.3) should be used between fields to ensure correct interpretation of\nthe information container ID by software applications.\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Table NA.1 - Descriptions of fields within the file information container ID</caption>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Summary</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Project</td>\n<td>What project does this information container relate to?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Originator</td>\n<td>Which party is responsible for producing this information container (as defined in the detailed responsibility matrix)?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Functional Break down</td>\n<td>Which functional aspect of the project does this information container relate to - for example system, work package, design topic?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spatial Breakdown</td>\n<td>Which spatial aspect of the project does this information container relate to - for ex ple region, location, floor level?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Form</td>\n<td>What is the nature of this information container?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Discipline</td>\n<td>Which (technical) branch of the industry is responsible for producing this information container?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number</td>\n<td>Sequential/grouped number to make the ID unique when all other fields are taken into account</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n#### NA.3.2 Proj t\n\nA single common project identifier should be defined at the initiation of the project in the project's\ninformation standard. It should be independent and recognizably distinct from any lead appointed\nparty's or appointed party's internal job number.\n\nNOTE 1 There are no standard codes for the project field. It is for the appointing party to define how the\nproject field is to be used, including its relationship to any asset identification procedures defined as part of an\nasset management system.\n\nLicensed copy: BOULTING ENVIRONMENTAL, 26/02/2021, Uncontrolled Copy, © BSI\n\n<!-- PageNumber: 29 -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader: BS EN ISO 19650-2:2018 -->\n\nNOTE 2 A project can be divided into sub-projects within the project identifier. This use of the project field\nshould be defined by the appointing party within the project's information standard.\n\nNOTE 3\nSubdivision of the Project field can be used to implement the federation strategy and the information\ncontainer breakdown structure, either on its own or in combination with the Functional Breakdown field and/or\nthe Spatial Breakdown field.\n\nNOTE 4\nWhere a project involves several parts, each part can be assigned a different project identifier.\n\nNOTE 5\nWh re possible, it is helpful if project codes are unique within an organization's portfolio of projects.\n\nNOTE 6\nLinks between the project identifier and the workspace within the project CDE solution should be\ndefined in the project's information standard.\n\n\n### NA.3.3 Originator\n\nA unique identifier should be defined for each organization on joining the project, to identify the\norganization responsible for producing the information within the information container. This unique\nidentifier should be fixed within the project's information standard.\n\nNOTE 1 This field identifies the organization of the information author as noted in 5.4.4.\n\nNOTE 2\nOrganizations that are prospective lead appointed parties can have their own preferred identifier and\npropose this in their tender response, but this would need to be agreed by the appointing party.\n\n\n### NA.3.4 Functional Breakdown\n\nA unique identifier should be defined for the functional aspects of the information container breakdown\nstructure. This can be based on physical subdivision (such as major design elements or systems) or\nnotional subdivision (such as security classification). The identifiers to be used should be fixed within\nthe project's information standard.\n\nThe following standard codes should apply:\n\n<!-- PageFooter: Licensed copy:BOULTING ENVIRONMENTAL, 26/02/2021, Uncontrolled Copy, © BSI -->\n\nZZ\nmultiple subdivisions apply to this information container\n\nXX\nno subdivision is applicable to this information container\n\nNOTE 1\nThis list can be expanded with project-specific codes. If these are chosen carefully, use of ZZ and XX\ncodes can be minimized.\n\nNOTE 2\nThe Functional Breakdown field can be used to implement the federation strategy and the information\ncontainer breakdown structure, either on its own or in combination with the Project field and/or the Spatial\nBreakdown field.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nFunctional Breakdown identifiers in a bridge project could include codes for abutments, piers,\ndecks and approach embankments.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\nFunctional Breakdown identifiers in a building project could include codes for substructure,\nsuperstructure, envelope and roof, mechanical systems, electrical systems, public health systems, floor and\nceiling systems, interior partitioning and finishes.\n\n\n### NA.3.5 Spatial Breakdown\n\nA unique identifier should be defined for each spatial subdivision and fixed within the project's\ninformation standard.\n\nThe following standard codes should apply:\n\nZZ\nmultiple spatial subdivisions are applicable\n\nXX\n✗\n\nno spatial subdivision is applicable\n\n<!-- PageNumber: 30 -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader: BS EN ISO 19650-2:2018 -->\n\nNOTE 1 This list can be expanded with project-specific codes such as codes representing levels (above and\nbelow ground), chainage, grid location or compass point references.\n\nNOTE 2 The Spatial Breakdown field can be used to implement the federation strategy and the information\ncontainer breakdown structure, either on its own or in combination with the Project field and/or the Functional\nBreakdown field.\n\nNOTE 3 The project's information standard can define an internal delimiter, different from the delimiter in\nNA.2.3, if this is needed to encode this field - see examples below.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe fourth floor of Wing B of a multistorey building with wings off the central structure could\nbe coded as B04 or Bx04.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\nA rail project comprising three sections of track linking four stations could code the track\nsections as T1, T2, T3 and the stations as S1, S2, S3, S4. Locations or spaces at Station 1 could be coded as\nS1x01, S1x02, etc.\n\n\n### NA.3.6 Form\n\nA unique identifier should be defined for each form of information held within the information\ncontainers and be fixed within the project's information standard.\n\nThe following standard codes, based on BS ISO 29845, should apply:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>D</th>\n<th>drawing</th>\n<th>Information in the form of a graphical depiction of shape, size, etc., of a physical part or assembly, usually to scale</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>G</th>\n<th>diagram</th>\n<th>Information in the form of a graphical/symbolic depiction showing the functions of the objects composing a system and their interrelationships using graphical elements and sym- bols, or the behaviour of variables using graphs</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>I</th>\n<th>image</th>\n<th>Information in the form of a static image or picture and not defining any relationships between objects</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>L</th>\n<th>list</th>\n<th>Information in the form of columns and rows, such as tables, spreadsheets and datasets</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>M</th>\n<th>model</th>\n<th>Two- or three-dimensional physical or digital description of the ideal shape of object(s) and/or space(s)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>T</th>\n<th>textual</th>\n<th>Information in the form of characters and paragraphs - for example in written instructions and descriptions</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>V</th>\n<th>vi o/audio</th>\n<th>Information in the form of moving images, animation or sound</th>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nNOTE 1 This list can be expanded with project-specific codes, which can extend the standard codes with\nadditional characters as suffixes.\n\nNOTE 2 For information containers with complex forms, the principal form should be used unless specified\notherwise in the project's information standard.\n\n\n### NA.3.7 Dis pline\n\nA unique identifier should be defined for each discipline to which information is related on the project\nand fixed within the project's information standard.\n\nLicensed copy:BOULTING ENVIRONMENTAL, 26/02/2021, Uncontrolled Copy, © BSI\n\n<!-- PageNumber: 31 -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nBS EN ISO 19650-2:2018\n\nThe following standard codes should apply:\n\nA\n\narchitecture\n\nB\n\nbuilding surveying\n\nC\ncivil engineering\n\nD\ndemolition/dismantling\n\nE\nelectrical engineering\n\nF\n\nf cilities/asset management\n\nG\nground engineering\n\nH\nhighways and transport engineering\n\nlandscape architecture\nL\n\nM\nmechanical engineering\n\n0\nother discipline\n\nP\npublic health engineering\n\nQ\nquantity surveying / cost consultancy\n\nR\nproject management\n\nS\nstructural engineering\n\nT\ntown and country planning and building control\n\nW\nw ter engineering\n\nX\nnon-discipline specific or not applicable\n\nY\ntopographical surveying\n\nZ\nmultiple disciplines\n\nNOTE 1\nThis list can be expanded with two-character project-specific codes.\n\nNOTE 2\nIf an information container is produced by a team within the appointing party (client), then this field\nis used to denote the technical specialism of that team and the Originator field is used to denote that it comes\nfrom the appointing party.\n\n\n### NA.3.8 Number\n\nWhen an information container ID is not unique using all the other fields, then this should be achieved\nusing a sequential number, which could be within a series/grouping. Such a grouping should be\ndocumented within the project's information standard.\n\nThe length of the number field for standard coding should be fixed within the project's information\nstandard.
