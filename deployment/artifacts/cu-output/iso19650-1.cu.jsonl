Information requirements need to pass along supply chains to the point\\nwhere information can be most efficiently produced, and information needs to be collated as it is passed\\nback. At present, considerable resources are spent on making corrections to unstructured information\\nor incorrect management of information by untrained personnel, on solving problems arising from\\nuncoordinated efforts of delivery teams, and on solving problems related to information reuse and\\nreproduction. These delays can be reduced if the concepts and principles within this document are\\nadopted.","chunkType":"paragraph","sectionId":null,"sectionTitle":"Introduction","paragraphId":"p0065","pageNumber":8,"startOffset":20907,"length":811,"sourceUrl":"https://stoo66445oeda3mts.blob.core.windows.net/bim-standards/source/iso19650-1.pdf","blobName":"source/iso19650-1.pdf","standardId":"BS EN ISO 19650-1:2018","standardTitle":"Organization and digitization of information about buildings and civil engineering works, including building information modelling (BIM) - Information management using building information modelling - Part 1: Concepts and principles","InformationStandard":"The managerial and commercial aspects should include the information standard and the production methods and procedures to be implemented by the delivery team.","IssuingOrganization":"The British Standards Institution","ReferenceInformationAndSharedResources":"In addition, some reference information can also be provided by the appointing party to one or more appointed parties.","CommonDataEnvironment":"agreed source of information (3.3.1) for any given project or asset (3.2.8), for collecting, managing and disseminating each information container (3.3.12) through a managed process","ResponsibilityMatrix":"chart that describes the participation by various functions in completing tasks or deliverables","TechnicalCommittee":"Technical Committee B/555, Construction design, modelling and data exchange","LessonsLearned":"there is a focus on sharing of lessons learned and continual improvement.","ApprovalDate":"2018-08-24","InformationProductionMethodsAndProcedures":"The managerial and commercial aspects should include the information standard and the production methods and procedures to be implemented by the delivery team.","ProjectInformationRequirements":"information requirements (3.3.2) in relation to the delivery of an asset (3.2.8)","CopyrightYear":"2019","AcceptanceCriteria":"Within the validation and verification methods it is vital that the approval and acceptance procedures should be agreed and documented before any information exchange takes place.","ExchangeInformationRequirements":"information requirements (3.3.2) in relation to an appointment (3.2.2)","LeadAppointedParty":"Appointed parties, including lead appointed parties, can add their own information requirements to those they receive.","AppointingParty":"receiver of information (3.3.1) concerning works, goods or services from a lead appointed party (3.2.3)","ICS":"35.240.67; 91.010.01","StandardNumber":"BS EN ISO 19650-1:2018","NationalImplementation":"This British Standard is the UK implementation of EN ISO 19650-1:2018.","TaskTeam":"individuals assembled to perform a specific task","AppointedParty":"provider of information (3.3.1) concerning works, goods or services","RiskRegister":"A documented risk assessment for delivery of asset or project information should be included in the overall asset or project risk assessment, so that the nature of the information delivery risks, their consequences and likelihood of occurring are understood, communicated and managed.","CopyrightHolder":"The British Standards Institution","CommitteeRepresentation":"A list of organizations represented on this committee can be obtained on request to its secretary.","PublicationDate":"2019-01-31","ISBN":"978 0 580 92466 8"}
